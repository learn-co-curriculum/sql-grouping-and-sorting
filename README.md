# Grouping and Sorting Data

## Objectives

- Explain the importance of grouping and sorting data stored in a database
- Group and sort data with the `GROUP BY()` and `ORDER BY()` keywords
- Craft advanced queries using aggregator functions along with sorting keywords
  and other conditional clauses

## Grouping and Sorting

SQL isn't picky about how it returns data to you, based on your queries. It will
simply return the relevant table rows in the order in which they exist in the
table. This is often insufficient for the purposes of data analysis and
organization.

How common is it to order a list of items alphabetically? Or numerically from
least to greatest?

We can tell our SQL queries and aggregate functions to group and sort our data
using several clauses:

- `ORDER BY()`
- `LIMIT`
- `GROUP BY()`
- `HAVING` and `WHERE`
- `ASC`/`DESC`

Let's take a closer look at how we use these keywords to narrow our search
criteria as well as to order and group the results.

## Setting up the Database

Some cats are very famous, and accordingly very wealthy. Our Pets Database will
have a `cats` table in which each cat has a name, age, breed, and net worth. Our
database will also have an `owners` table and `cats_owners` join table so that a
cat can have many owners and an owner can have many cats.

**Creating the Database:**

In your terminal, create the database and start `sqlite3` with the following:

```bash
sqlite3 pets_database.db
```

**Creating the tables:**

Create the tables by entering the commands below at the `sqlite>` prompt:

**`cats` table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE cats (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER,
  breed TEXT,
  net_worth INTEGER
);
```

**`owners` Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE owners (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
```

**`cats_owners` Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE cats_owners (
  cat_id INTEGER,
  owner_id INTEGER
);
```

**Inserting the values:**

Finally, to insert the values, enter the following:

**`cats`:**

```sql
INSERT INTO cats (id, name, age, breed, net_worth) VALUES (1, "Maru", 3, "Scottish Fold", 1000000);
INSERT INTO cats (id, name, age, breed, net_worth) VALUES (2, "Hana", 1, "Tabby", 21800);
INSERT INTO cats (id, name, age, breed, net_worth) VALUES (3, "Grumpy Cat", 4, "Persian", 181600);
INSERT INTO cats (id, name, age, breed, net_worth) VALUES (4, "Lil\' Bub", 2, "Tortoiseshell", 2000000);
```

**`owners`:**

```sql
INSERT INTO owners (name) VALUES ("mugumogu");
INSERT INTO owners (name) VALUES ("Sophie");
INSERT INTO owners (name) VALUES ("Penny");
```

**`cats_owners`:**

```sql
INSERT INTO cats_owners (cat_id, owner_id) VALUES (2, 2);
INSERT INTO cats_owners (cat_id, owner_id) VALUES (4, 3);
INSERT INTO cats_owners (cat_id, owner_id) VALUES (1, 2);
```

### Code Along I: `ORDER BY()`

#### Syntax

The general syntax for selecting values and sorting them is:

```sql
SELECT column_name, column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC, column_name DESC;
```

Note that `ORDER BY()` will automatically sort the returned values in
ascending order so the use of the `ASC` keyword is optional. If we want
to sort in descending order instead, we need to use the `DESC` keyword.

#### Exercise

Imagine you're working for an important investment firm in Manhattan. The
investors are interested in investing in a lucrative and popular cat. They need
your help to decide which cat that will be. They want a list of famous and
wealthy cats. We can do that by running a basic `SELECT` statement at the
`sqlite>` prompt:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE net_worth > 0;
```

This will return:

```txt
id           name             age         breed          net_worth
-----------  ---------------  ----------  -------------  ----------
1            Maru             3           Scottish Fold  1000000
2            Hana             1           Tabby          21800
3            Grumpy Cat       4           Persian        181600
4            Lil\' Bub        2           Tortoiseshell  2000000
```

Our investors are busy people though. They don't have time to manually sort
through this list of cats for the best candidate. They want you to return the
list to them with the cats sorted by net worth, from greatest to least.

We can do so with the following line:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY(net_worth) DESC;
```

This will return:

```txt
id           name             age         breed          net_worth
-----------  ---------------  ----------  -------------  ----------
4            Lil\' Bub        2           Tortoiseshell  2000000
1            Maru             3           Scottish Fold  1000000
3            Grumpy Cat       4           Persian        181600
2            Hana             1           Tabby          21800
```

### Code Along II: The `LIMIT` Keyword

Turns out our investors are very impatient. They don't want to review the list
themselves, they just want you to return to them the wealthiest cat. We can
accomplish this by using the `LIMIT` keyword with the above query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY(net_worth) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

Which will return:

```txt
name             age         breed          net_worth
---------------  ----------  -------------  ----------
Lil\' Bub        2           Tortoiseshell  2000000
```

The `LIMIT` keyword specifies how many of the records resulting from the query
you'd like to actually return. In this case, because we've sorted the records
in descending order by net worth and set the `LIMIT` to 1, the wealthiest cat
is returned.

### Code Along III: `GROUP BY()`

The `GROUP BY()` keyword is very similar to `ORDER BY()`. The main difference is
that `ORDER BY()` sorts sets of data returned by basic queries while `GROUP BY()`
sorts sets of data returned by aggregate functions.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value
GROUP BY column_name;
```

#### Exercise

Let's calculate the sum of the net worth of all of the cats, grouped by owner name:

```sql
SELECT owners.name, SUM(cats.net_worth)
FROM owners
INNER JOIN cats_owners
ON owners.id = cats_owners.owner_id
JOIN cats ON cats_owners.cat_id = cats.id
GROUP BY owners.name;
```

This should return:

```txt
owners.name      SUM(cats.net_worth)
---------------  -------------------
Penny            2000000
Sophie           1021800
```

> **Note**: If you have headers turned on, the headers you see in your terminal
> may differ from the ones displayed here and below.

In the above query, we've implemented _two_ joins. First, we're joining `owners`
and `cat_owners` on `owners.id = cats_owners.owner_id`. This first joined table
would look like the following if we were to query it:

```txt
owners.id  owners.name      cat_owners.cat_id  cat_owners.owner_id
---------  -----------      -----------------  -------------------
2          Sophie           2                  2
3          Penny            4                  3
2          Sophie           1                  2
```

With this table, we then implement a _second_ join with `cats` on
`cats_owners.cat_id = cats.id`. To better understand this, try running the
provided query, but select _everything_ rather than just the owner's name and
the sum of their cats' net worth, and remove the `GROUP BY` line. You'll be able
to see all three tables have been joined.

In our example query above, we need to use the `SUM(cats.net_worth)` aggregator
in conjunction with `GROUP BY` to get the information we want. Without `GROUP BY`,
only the first owner in the table would be returned, along with the sum of the
net worth of _all_ the cats:

```txt
owners.name      SUM(cats.net_worth)
---------------  -------------------
Sophie           3021800
```

If, on the other hand, we forget to use `SUM` and just get `cats.net_worth`,
the results will be grouped by owner, but only the net worth of the _first_
cat belonging to each owner will be returned, not the aggregate:

```txt
owners.name      cats.net_worth
---------------  ---------------
Penny            2000000
Sophie           21800
```

When we use `SUM` and `GROUP BY` together, `SUM` looks at all of the values in
the `net_worth` column of the `cats` table (or whichever column you specify in
parentheses) and takes the sum of those values, but only _after those cats have
been grouped by owner_:

```txt
owners.name      SUM(cats.net_worth)
---------------  -------------------
Penny            2000000
Sophie           1021800
```

In our original data, Penny is the owner of Lil' Bub (2000000) while Sophie is
the owner of Maru and Hana (1000000 + 21800).

### Code Along IV: `HAVING` vs `WHERE` clause

Suppose we have a table called `employee_bonus` as shown below. Note that the
table has multiple entries for employees Abigail and Matthew.

**`employee_bonus`**:

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>Employee</th>
    <th>Bonus</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Matthew</td>
    <td>1000</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Abigail</td>
    <td>2000</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Matthew</td>
    <td>500</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Tom</td>
    <td>700</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Abigail</td>
    <td>1250</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To calculate the total bonus that each employee received, we would write a SQL
statement like this:

```sql
SELECT employee, SUM(bonus) FROM employee_bonus GROUP BY employee;
```

This should return:

```txt
employee         SUM(bonus)
---------------  -------------------
Abigail          3250
Matthew          1500
Tom              700
```

Now, suppose we wanted to find the employees who received more than $1,000 in
bonuses. You might think that we could write a query like this:

```sql
BAD SQL:
SELECT employee, SUM(bonus) FROM employee_bonus
GROUP BY employee WHERE SUM(bonus) > 1000;
```

Unfortunately, the above will not work because the `WHERE` clause can't be used
with aggregates (`SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, etc). What we need to use is the `HAVING`
clause. The `HAVING` clause was added to SQL so that we could compare aggregates
in the same way that the `WHERE` clause can be used for comparing non-aggregates.
Now, the correct SQL will look like this:

```sql
GOOD SQL:
SELECT employee, SUM(bonus) FROM employee_bonus
GROUP BY employee HAVING SUM(bonus) > 1000;
```

#### Difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE` clause

The difference between the `HAVING` and `WHERE` clauses in SQL is that the
`WHERE` clause cannot be used with aggregates while the `HAVING` clause can.
`HAVING` filters out groups of rows created by `GROUP BY`, and `WHERE` filters
out individual rows. Note that there is nothing to stop you from using both
of them in the same query.

Finally, it is important to remember that order matters here: `WHERE` must
come **before** `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` must come **after** it, as shown
below; changing the order will produce a syntax error.

```sql
SELECT
FROM
JOIN
  ON
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
LIMIT
```
